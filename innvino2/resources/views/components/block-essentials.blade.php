                Pressing is the act of applying pressure to grapes or pomace in order to separate juice or wine from
                grapes and grape skins. Pressing is not always a necessary act in winemaking; if grapes are crushed
                there is a considerable amount of juice immediately liberated (called free-run juice) that can be used
                for vinification. Typically this free-run juice is of a higher quality than the press juice.
